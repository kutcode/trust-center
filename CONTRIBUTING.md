# Contributing to Trust Center

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Trust Center! We welcome contributions from the community through pull requests.

## 📋 Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** — See if your idea/bug is already being discussed
2. **Open an issue first** — For significant changes, discuss your approach before coding
3. **Read the docs** — Familiarize yourself with the project structure and code style

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trust-center.git
cd trust-center
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:4000
- Supabase Studio: http://localhost:54323
- Mailpit (emails): http://localhost:8025

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` — New features
- `fix/` — Bug fixes
- `docs/` — Documentation changes
- `refactor/` — Code refactoring
- `test/` — Test additions

## 💻 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript** — All new code must be in TypeScript
- **Formatting** — Follow existing code patterns
- **Naming** — Use clear, descriptive names
- **Comments** — Add comments for complex logic
- **No console.log** — Remove debug statements before committing
